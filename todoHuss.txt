**********

Thurs
- Player and player movement DONE
- Adventure map DONE

Fri
- Levels and level transitions . there are no interiors. DONE
- Save and load system - and being able to track the state of every 'changeable' object, e.g. NPC states, quest states, monster states. Use a Data object for each entity, each implementing a common interface "IStoreable" or similar. Coordinate with Sarah to use the same system. DONE
- Autosaves DONE

Sat
NEXT: neutral NPC -> wander mode or stationary mode. dialogue on E DONE
THEN: hostile NPC -> wander mode, stationary mode, or patrol mode. DONE
THEN: all NPCs -> right-click: show information such as hostile, and minions. DONE
THEN: hostile NPC - on area overlap -> BOX -> "dude and his minions attack!" -> Battle map DONE
- NPCs in the adventure map (idle, patrolling, with indicator of how many) *So plan is to make an NPC scene that contains an NPCData object. Part of this will be a DialogueDict which will be where you will store all of your variables from your dialogue system Sarah. NPCData will also contain information about the fights that would start if the NPC became hostile. E.g. encounter in battlemap would initiate with 5 wasps 3 beetles etc. All the NPC data will be packed and unpacked every time save/load and also on level transition. DONE
- NPCs have a toggleable companion flag, and if activated, follow the player. Join party, and save state on save and between levels DONE
- you must gather your party before venturing forth DONE
- Battle map and transition between adventure and battle maps DONE
- Readjust weekly targets as per progress
